## Picture-In-Picture
This is an awesome web application that I coded up for having a picture-in-picuture of any screen of your browser. I am using the picture-in-picture API for this.
Feel free to download this and run it. You just need to select the window or application that you want to picture-in-picture and then hit begin to start the picture-in-picture
effect. It is really cool. Just try it once.
